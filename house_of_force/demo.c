Post url :      https://raydenchia.com/heaps-of-fun-with-glibc-malloc/
File : demo.c
## how-to-compile:
     gcc -w -g -o demo demo.c
## then to debug with gdb:
    gdb demo
    and break main or b main
    then run or just r followed by next or just n
    vmmap
    vis_heap_chunk or vis to see heap
    print p9 or p p9 to see addr of var p9
